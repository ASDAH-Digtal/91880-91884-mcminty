     <p>Growing up, I always listened to music. Ive always had passion in music because it would help me when I feel down. I have a lot of family members who has talent in music. I hope to master all instruments. My favourite instrument is the piano because theres so much things you can do on it. Theres so many song style to play. My favourite song style to play on the piano is blues, latin, rocknroll and gospel. I hope to pursue a career in playing the piano.</p>

   <div class="sectionTwo"><p>Ive always had heart for rugby league and it was one of my biggest dreams as a kid to make it to NRL and play rugby league proffesionally. rugby league would also help me because it distracted me from all the assignments at school and sometimes stress. My family is the biggest supporters when it and hope that I make the nrl.</div><!--sectionTwo-->
